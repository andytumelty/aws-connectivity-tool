AWS connectivity: "why can/can't instance i-123abc connect to i-456def"

primary goal:
- what resources are involved in connectivity between two instances, and what
  connectivity is allowed/will they allow connectivity on port x [protocol y]


instance <> instance
(could also do instance to elb?)


Impacting resources:
- i-a security group outbound
- i-b security group inbound
- different vpc
  - vpc peering
  - peering routing
  - network ASG outbound VPC outbound rule, and inbound ephemeral
  - network ASG inbound VPC inbound rule, and outbound ephemeral
- same vpc different subnet - subnet routing

security group selection:
- source/dst sg
- source/dst ip


secondary goal:
- where are the open holes in my network?
- what resources have a lot of dependencies?


possible extensions:
- non-AWS routing (e.g. virtual firewalls: ssh to instances to determine
  instance routing - assumes ssh config has been setup)
